"""Requirement -> test traceability check.

Constitution Article X: a claim is proved by a test, not by assertion. This script
is what makes that enforceable rather than aspirational.

For every `docs/specs/NNNN-*/spec.md` it reads two tables — the requirements in the
section titled "Requirements", and the mapping in the section titled "Traceability"
— and checks that they agree with each other and with the test suite as it actually
exists on disk.

It fails the build on a *broken link*:

  * a requirement that is declared but never traced, or traced but never declared;
  * a requirement traced twice;
  * a named test that does not exist (the common case: a test was renamed).

It does **not** fail on a declared `GAP` or `DEFERRED`. Those are tracked debt, and
forcing them to be written down is the point — a spec that must name its gaps cannot
quietly have them. They are reported on every run so they stay visible.

Tests are indexed by parsing the files with `ast` rather than by asking pytest,
because pytest's collection output format is not a stable interface and this check
must keep working across pytest versions.
